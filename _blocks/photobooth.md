As part of Horizons 2019, we're offering a photo booth powered by artificial intelligence and computer science! You can take a picture and get a stylized version of your photo back.

1. During lunch or dinner, try out the photo booth in the Klaus Atrium!
2. Text a photo to `(678) 916-9594`. You'll get a text back with a stylized version of your photo!
