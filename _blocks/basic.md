#### **Wifi**
For much faster speeds, if you attend a university that uses **[eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/where/)**, connect to eduroam with your school's authentication credentials.

For example, Georgia Tech students would use username `<GT Username>@gatech.edu` and their campus password.

Otherwise, connect to the **GTVisitor** network.
