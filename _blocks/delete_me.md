This is the HackGT Live Site base template.  Edit it to your liking, and be sure to **DELETE THIS BLOCK*** before deploying this for real!  If you encounter a problem, make an issue on the [live-site Github repo](https://github.com/HackGT/live-site).

For help editing the site, see the [wiki](https://github.com/HackGT/live-site/wiki).

Be sure to follow the Event Live Site Checklist to make sure you cover all the bases and catch all the small things (all of them!).

*Don't know how to delete this block, eh?  Here's how:

1. Go to the `/_blocks` directory and delete the `delete_me.md` file
2. Go to the `/_event_pages` directory and remove the line under `left_blocks` at the top that looks like `- delete_me.md`
