#### How do I connect to the Wi-Fi?
For much faster speeds, if you attend a university that uses **[eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/where/)**, connect to eduroam with your school's authentication credentials. 

For example, Georgia Tech students would use username `<GT Username>@gatech.edu` and their campus password. 

Otherwise, connect to the **GTVisitor** network.

#### How do I contact a mentor?
Join the #mentorship channel on [Slack](https://hackgt5.slack.com) to get in touch with mentors!

#### What are the sponsor challenges?
Sponsor challenges and prizes can be found on the [HackGT 5 Devpost](https://hackgt2018.devpost.com/).
