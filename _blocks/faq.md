#### How do I connect to the Wi-Fi?
For much faster speeds, if you attend a university that uses **[eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/where/)**, connect to eduroam with your school's authentication credentials. 

For example, Georgia Tech students would use username `<GT Username>@gatech.edu` and their campus password. 

Otherwise, connect to the GTVisitor network.

#### How do I contact a mentor?
Join the #mentorship channel on Slack to get in touch with mentors!
