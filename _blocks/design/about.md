### **About**
Design Track focuses on the intersection of art and programming, bridging the gap between tech and design. Learn the fundamentals of computer science through three structured hands-on art projects dealing with music visualization, animation, graphic design, and much more! At the end of the day, students get to bring home their own digital art portfolio and newfound knowledge of computer science.
