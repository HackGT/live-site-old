A DIY enthusiast, accomplished classical pianist and cellist, high school senior Alice Barbe was named “Most Promising Instrument Designer” at the 2019 Guthman New Instrument Competition for her invention, the Biot-Savharp, born of her work using electromagnets to acoustically actuate strings. In 2015, she founded Project Music Connector, a Georgia Tech student collective that seeks to create new digital musical instruments and share them through educational outreach partnerships.

<br/><br/>
I work with emerging media forms to facilitate social change. My specific focus is on community storytelling with augmented and virtual reality. I collaborate with community leaders, artists, educators, writers, and students on stories of communal significance. To enable these kinds of experiences, I have created local partnerships with the Peachtree and Pine Homeless Shelter, the Arthur M. Blank Foundation, and the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition.  Over the years, I have become an established public speaker and storyteller with performances, lectures, and talks on digital publishing, interactive narratives, and augmented reality.
