<br/><br/>
Jeff is a beat maker, freestyle dancer and music lover. Starting as a guitarist, his path as a musician was interrupted when he discovered the various street dance styles that were represented in the freestyle dance community of his hometown of Sacramento. Through his experiences growing as a dancer he became more connected with the music genres present in this dance community: House, Hip Hop, Funk, Soul, and eventually Chicago Footwork music. These experiences have continuously influenced his process of music-making.

Ves highly interested in how technology affects art - music in particular. While the more intuitive understanding of the matter is that technology is meant to simply be a tool to create art, history shows that music tools, such as the Roland 808 drum machine or the Yamaha CS-80 show how the gear affects the creative process. Ves will discuss his own music tool, a drum machine made from a moog synthesizer and an arduino and some analog components and show that while technology limits creation, creativity makes technology unlimited.
