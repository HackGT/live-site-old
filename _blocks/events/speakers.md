**Ves Grantcharov** Ves highly interested in how technology affects art - music in particular. While the more intuitive understanding of the matter is that technology is meant to simply be a tool to create art, history shows that music tools, such as the Roland 808 drum machine or the Yamaha CS-80 show how the gear affects the creative process. Ves will discuss his own music tool, a drum machine made from a moog synthesizer and an arduino and some analog components and show that while technology limits creation, creativity makes technology unlimited.
