#### Project Submission
You must submit your project on **[Devpost](https://hackgt2018.devpost.com/) by 8:00 AM**. You are free to continue working on your project and editing your Devpost submission until 9:00 AM, when hacking officially ends. 

#### Judging Process
After project submission, all teams will be assigned to an expo session (Expo 1 or Expo 2) and a table number. Expo 1 is from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, and Expo 2 is from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM Teams will present their project to judges in a science fair style. Projects are judged on four categories: technical depth, design and usability, presentation, and novelty of idea.
