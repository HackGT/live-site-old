  There's a new event on the horizon! HackGT is presenting an Art+Tech make-a-thon called Horizons, where participants get to brainstorm, design, and create projects integrating art and technology. At the end of the event, we'll have a showcase of all the projects and judges will vote for specific categories of prizes.

  Feel unprepared? Don't worry! We'll have plenty of mentors on hand to help with projects, presentations, idea creation, and technical difficulties!
