description: >- # >- means ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Looking to inspire and challenge our attendees, HackGT’s 5th annual 36-hour hackathon will help students develop their
   skills, explore new technologies, and turn their curiosities into opportunities. Participants are invited to discover
    friendly campgrounds, lush landscapes, and a spirit of adventure — inspired by the diverse beauty of America's
    National Parks from Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon to the Olympic Peninsula and Denali.
