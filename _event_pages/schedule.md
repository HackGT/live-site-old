  # All calendars on the same page must use the same API key and have the same start/end dates/times

  start_datetime: "2019-04-05T17:30:00-0500" #Be sure to enclose this in quotes so Jekyll doesn't interpret as a Date!
  end_datetime: "2019-04-06T22:30:01-0500" #This is the absolute latest start time to include an event on the page.  The timestamp is exclusive, meaning that to include events at 3:00 PM, you would write T15:01:00 (includes events starting as late as 15:00:59)
